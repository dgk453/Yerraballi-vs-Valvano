# Yerraballi-vs-Valvano
This is code for a fun two player turn based game. Similar to Tanks or Gorillas each side gets a turn throwing their projectile to hit the opponent. However, in this game the two players are UT Austin Electrical Engineering professors and are throwing EK-TM4C123GXL at each other. The first person to hit the opposing professor wins their round. First person to three in a best of five wins and gets a custom victory screen. This game requires hardware components such as a EK-TM4C123GXL, breadboard, wires, resistors, speaker, sliding pot potentiometer, buttons, and a power source.
